1. Create a Binary Store for storing record. 
   Every record can contain multiple versions
2. Create a Binary Store for storing schema
3. Create the ability to diff the last version with the latest version. 
   Replace the last version with the diff and append the full columnset 
   of the latest version at the end of version list. 
4. Stream the file for binary store thru a MR-Pig infrastructure and reconstruct the first version of each record and then output it to a new table. 
5. Write a unit test that vcan verify that this works correctly. Add the test to a test suite.
